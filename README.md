Making a declare war game


the purpose of this game is to work on Object orientated program 


I will build a game where players are dealt a split deck and will compare cards 
if player one cards is greater than player two, player one will get all cards
else player two cards is greater than player one, player two will get all cards
else both players cards match in this case war happens. 

when war is declared both player will draws cards and who ever has the highest cards when all the cards

the game is over when one player does not have any cards

i will attempt to build three class
